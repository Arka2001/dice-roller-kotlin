## Dice Roller Android App in Kotlin

This app is a very basic app built to understand how to provide interactivity to an android app and how to change the state of the app through such interactivity.

What this app does is that it displays 2 dice and a button underneath them.

On clcking the button, some random numbers are generated and the faces of the dice also change depending on the random numbers generated on clicking the button.
